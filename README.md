# Maschke's Theorem in LEAN

The goal of this project is to give a proof of Maschke's Theorem in the proof-checking language LEAN. 
I have essentially given a proof of Schur's lemma, and am now building up the relevant theory needed in the proof of Maschke's theorem, such as short exact sequences of vector spaces.
