# Maske's Theorem in LEAN

The goal of this project is to give a proof of Maske's Theorem in the proof-checking language LEAN. 
Currently, I have given a proof of Schur's lemma, modulo some kind of bug with lean. I am now building up the relevant theory needed in the proof of Maschke's theorem, such as short exact sequences of vector spaces.
